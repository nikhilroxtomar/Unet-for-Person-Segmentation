# Unet for Person Segmentation
We are using the famous UNet architecture for segmenting person from an image. For the person segmentation, we are going to use the person segmentation dataset. U-Net is built for Biomedical Image Segmentation. It is the base model for any segmentation task. It follows an encoder-decoder approach. It used skip connection to get the local information during downsampling path and use it during the upsampling path.

These images are generated after the model is trained on 2 epochs.
